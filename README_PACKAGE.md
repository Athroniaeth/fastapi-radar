```

## Quick Start

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi_radar import Radar
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

app = FastAPI()
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///./app.db")

# Initialize Radar - automatically adds middleware and mounts dashboard
radar = Radar(app, db_engine=engine)
radar.create_tables()

# Your routes work unchanged
@app.get("/users")
async def get_users():
    return {"users": []}
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/__radar` to see your debugging dashboard.

```python
radar = Radar(
    app,
    db_engine=engine,
    dashboard_path="/__radar",     # Dashboard URL path
    max_requests=1000,              # Max requests to store
    retention_hours=24,             # Auto-cleanup after 24h
    slow_query_threshold=100,       # Highlight queries >100ms
    capture_sql_bindings=True,      # Include SQL parameters
    exclude_paths=["/health"],      # Ignore certain routes
